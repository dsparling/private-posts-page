Private Posts Page allows you to set your posts page (blog) to private without having to make all the indiviual posts themselves private. The feed will also be set to private.

== Description ==

Private Posts Page will force your designated posts page (blog) to behave like any normal page that is set to private visibility. That is, for non-logged in users the page will return a 404 error and the posts page title will be removed from the menu. Additionally, all posts will be set as private as well. The feed will similarly be disabled and search will not return private pages in results.

== Installation ==

Copy to plugins (`/wp-content/plugins/`) folder and activate.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Q. I'd like to be able to set my individual posts visibility separately. Can I do that?**

Private Post Pages was originally written to fill a specific need of mine and I decided to share my work. If there's something you would like added (and it makes sense in the context of what this plugin is trying to achieve), please let me know. That said, I eventually may add an options admin regardless. But your input is important!

**Q. From where will my posts be hidden?**

None of your blog posts will be displayed on the front/home page or designated blog page. Posts will not be shown on the archive pages, authors page, category page, tag page and will also be removed from the feed and will not be displayed in search results. However, the posts title will be displayed in the default "Recent Posts" and "Recent Comments" widgets. If you're making your entire blog private, just remove these widgets from your theme.
